# Blackjack | July 2020 | On Hold

Blackjack is a text based game of blackjack. I can't remember a lot of the rules of blackjack but I wanted to try taking a ruleset with some strange exceptions and implement it with code.

The game was intended to have a graphical interface as well (hence the card assets) but implementing graphical interfaces is a huge point of tedium for me and I've been putting it off for a while. I am, however, pretty happy with how this project turned out and I think it'd be worthwhile to give it the interface it deserves once I find a graphical process I'm comfortable working with.

### Ideas To Improve

A graphical interface is the #1 priority as far as features go. In addition, I think this could use a bit of input testing.

### How To Use

Run the program via CLI: `py ./blackjack.py`.

At the start of the round you will be asked to place a bet. You start with $500 so enter a number less than 500.

The dealer will then deal a card, flip a card, deal another card, then place a card face down. Your hand and the dealer's visible hand will be displayed along with the sum value of the cards.

Enter `y` to hit or anything else to stand.
