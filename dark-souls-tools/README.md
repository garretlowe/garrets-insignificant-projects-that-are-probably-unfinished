# Dark Souls Tools | December 2021 | On Hold

This folder is the basis for a set of projects I was planning involving calculating optimal equipment options for user defined stat allocations.

In its current state, this is simply an incomplete resource file and a script to unit test it's validity. I had to take a break from this because I was enting the data manually which was tiresome. I had planned to make a web page scraping tool to alleviate this but I never got around to it.

### Idead To Improve

Finish the resource, build a web scraper if I think its necessary, and start working on the actual build tools and calculators.

### How To Use

Nothing to run here except the validation too which is simply run via CLI: `py ./validate_weapons.py`... I guess use the data file as you see fit, although it's currently incomplete.

### Learning Outcomes

Python, JSON, Unit Testing
