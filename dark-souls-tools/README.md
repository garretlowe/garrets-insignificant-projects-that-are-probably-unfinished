# Dark Souls Tools | December 2021 | On Hold

This folder is the basis for a set of projects I was planning involving calculating optimal equipment options for user defined stat allocations.

In its current state, this is simply a resource file and a script to unit test it's validity. I had planned to make a web page scraping tool to alleviate this but I never got around to it.

### Idead To Improve

Start working on the actual build tools and calculators.

### How To Use

Nothing to run here except the validation tool which is simply run via CLI: `py ./validate_weapons.py`... I guess use the data file as you see fit.

### Learning Outcomes

Python, JSON, Unit Testing
