# Elden Ring Map Stitcher | March 2022 | Completed

This is a series of tools I used to scrape map tiles from the [Fextralife Elden Ring Interactive Map](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map) and stitch them together to make a single [high resolution map](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/84) image.

While the utility itself is broken since I modified it heavily during multiple stages of development without care for the previous scripts, this project is technically completed since the product aimed to be made with it was ultimately made.

### Ideas To Improve

I could fix compatibility between the scripts and provide a generalized utility for generating stitched map tiles for this format of interactive map.

### How To Use

In its current state and setup, it's unlikely to work without some structural changes. Mostly included here for archival purposes incase I want to do another project linke this so I don't have to start again from scratch.

### Learning Outcomes

Python, Web Scraping, Image Manipulation
