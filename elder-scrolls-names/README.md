# Elder Scrolls Names | February 2022 | Dropped

Pretty much the same as my `language-generalizer` project except I tried to make a GUI for this one.

### Ideas To Improve

Use Machine Learning instead of whatever I was trying to do.

### How To Use

Run via CLI: `py ./main.py`

GUI is currently non-functionalbut can be run via `py ./gui.py`.

### Learning Outcomes

Python, tkinter, CSV

### Resources
