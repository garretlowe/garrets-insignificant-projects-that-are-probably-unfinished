# MH: Rise Fextralife Scrubber | March 2022 | On Hold

I made this tool to ease the data entry for my steam guide: [A Hunter's Bestiary - Large/Apex Monster Stat Pages](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2732708878). The idea of the guide was to provide the important information from the wiki without the ads/embeds which lag the Steam Overlay Web Browser.

Right now the page parses the text a user selects from the page manually and pastes into a text file. I lost interest in the game at the time so I stopped working on this. And, the manual process was too tedious.

### Ideas To Improve

Automate Web Scrubbing and allow bulk scrubbing of multiple pages.

### How To Use

Copy the contents of a monster page from fextralife into a new file called: `input.txt`.

Run the program via CLI: `py ./main.py`.

Output will be savced to a file called: `output.txt`.

### Learning Outcomes

Python, Web Scrubbing, BB Code
