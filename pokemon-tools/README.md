# Pok√©mon Tools | December 2021 | Completed

The base resource for a series of pok√©mon tools.

## Triad Calculator | December 2021 | Completed

Finds starter options or groups of three pokemon types that are each super effective and uneffective to eachother in a chain.

Updated June 2024 as an exercise in functional programming. Also the old version was yucky to look at ü§¢.

### How To Use

Run via CLI: `py triad-calculator/main.py`.

### Learning Outcomes

Python, JSON

## Party Calculator | August 2022 | On Hold

Finds a party composition which is optimally effective to all types.

### Ideas To Improve

Make it work :) Currently this is very expensive computationally. I've had the idea to give each type a rating for how worthy of a placement it is. A lot of work to do left on this to make it work though.
